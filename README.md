*https://github.com/cookecn/groupProject1

**This group project had our group assemble a user-friendly web-application that used at least two api's. A lot of our problems came from the api calls, but once we smashed those problems, everything came together.

*https://github.com/cookecn/unit-4-game

**This game has the user pick crystals with random values to match the randomly generated number given by the computer. If the user matches that number at the end, game over, you win. The problems that this project gave me were mainly around generating the random values per item clicked, as well as having the computer randomnly generate a value. I used stackOverflow primarily to figure this out.

*https://github.com/cookecn/TriviaGame

**This game has the user select answers to 10 questions on a 60 second timer. The challenge was getting the game to reset at 60 seconds after completion, or failure. I used a lot of stackOverflow and other students in our classroom to create a function that resets the game and clears all the answers.

**This project has the user guess random letters trying to match the computers. The problems with this project came from the countdown of numbers always reaching 2, and I still have problems getting that sorted out.

*https://github.com/train

**This project allows the user to store information about trains via firebase to the document. The challenge with this project was getting the firebase and moment.js to function properly on user input. I figured this one out somewhat accidentally, but a lot of help came from other students in the class.

*https://github.com/giphyAjax

**This was one of my favorite projects, as it felt more wild and designer friendly. The user can input an item, and that item would be stored in a button. Once the button is clicked, the user will see 10 GIFs appear on the screen with the ability to activate them or inactivate them. The challenge with this was 100% in the activation/de-activation of the GIFs. I used data-attributes to give each individual GIF an attribute of active/inactive, and on user-click, the GIF would switch to the other attribute.

# About
The updated portfolio is basically a new version of the origional portfolio we created, but allowing us to control what we put in there. This was a lot of fun testing what I could and couldn't use in the portfolio. This will most likely be changed almost completely in the future, but still fun nontheless. 
# Future Additions:
* In the future, I will add the ability for the protfolio page to reflect both the project and its github location. Once I have mostly completed the Trilogy course at Vanderbilt I will add this feature. I also, want to remove the "about me" page photos and replace with icons that represent the courses/tecchnologies that I have knowledge and expertise in.
# Contributions
* As of now, this repository should only be changed/altered via Vanderbilt University professors and TA's from the bootcamp.
